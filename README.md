# # Haxe-WiiU - WUT toolchain
With this library, you can make use of the [WUT toolchain](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) functions natively in Haxe, to develop homebrew for the Nintendo Wii U. This is a library in conjunction with [HxCompileU](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/hxCompileU), which is the utility for compiling to the Wii U using [Reflaxe.CPP](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/reflaxe.CPP).


This library is **NOT** for normal use in Haxe, do not try to use it in a common project.

This library is __very incomplete__, because the [WUT toolchain](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) itself is quite extensive. Also this library has not been really tested.

# Installation
To install this library, just install it through Haxelib:
```
haxelib git hxu_wut https://github.com/Haxe-WiiU/HxU_WUT
```
This library is already included automatically when using [HxCompileU](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/hxCompileU).
