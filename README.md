# hxWUT
With this library, you can make use of the [WUT toolchain](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) functions natively in Haxe, to develop homebrew for the Nintendo Wii U. This is a library in conjunction with [HxCompileU](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/hxCompileU), which is the utility for compiling to the Wii U using [Reflaxe.CPP](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/reflaxe.CPP).


This library is **NOT** for normal use in Haxe, do not try to use it in a common project.

This library is __very incomplete__, because the [WUT toolchain](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) itself is quite extensive. Also this library has not been really tested, but there is enough to print a “hello world” on the console screen.
